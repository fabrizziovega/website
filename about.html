                <p>Undergraduate student majoring in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Currently applying to doctoral programs in mechanical engineering for Fall 2024; plan to focus in energy transfer. Career goals include working at a national lab as a researcher and eventually transitioning into a teaching position as a professor; I believe teaching is the greatest thing one can do in life and I wish for it to be the way that I live on.</p>
               
                <p id="about-bottom-paragraph">I am a second-generation Mexican immigrant born in Chicago, IL. I have two sisters, one of which is my fraternal twin. Despite having an allergy to dogs, I find myself living with three of them, all toy poodle mixes: Hershy, Apricot, and Fiona. I enjoy being outdoors, going on runs, birdwatching, and gardening. When I am at home in Chicago, I really like to walk along the Waterfall Glen trail in Lemont, IL. I also like to play video games with my friends; I currently enjoy playing Overwatch and Apex Legends.</p>
